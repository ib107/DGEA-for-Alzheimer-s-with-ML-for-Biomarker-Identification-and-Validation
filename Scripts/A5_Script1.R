# In RNA-Seq analysis, lowly expressed genes (i.e., genes with low counts across most samples) are often excluded
# to reduce noise and improve statistical power. Genes that are expressed in fewer than 2 samples (threshold of 10 counts per sample) will be removed to focus on genes that show variation across the samples, reducing the impact of noise.

# Filtering: High Zero Counts
filtered_data <- filter_high_zero_counts(filtered_data, zero_threshold = 80)
cat("Filtered dataset dimensions (high zero count genes removed):", dim(filtered_data), "\n")

# Handling Missing Data:

gene_missing_percentage <- rowSums(is.na(filtered_data)) / ncol(filtered_data)
filtered_data <- filtered_data[gene_missing_percentage <= missing_threshold, ]

# In RNA-Seq data, missing values can occur due to technical issues or biological reasons. Genes with more than 20% missing values across samples will be filtered and excluded from the analysis.
# This threshold is chosen to ensure that genes with sufficient data is used.

It can be a good indicator of evaluating the effectiveness of normalization techniques and ensuring consistency between experimental groups.

# This heatmap provides an initial look at the genes driving variability in the dataset, which may include biomarkers or genes associated with disease pathology. The clustering of samples by condition (AD vs. Control) suggests the presence of biologically relevant differences. Moreover, hierarchical clustering of genes can identify groups of co-expressed genes, which may reveal pathways or gene networks of interest for further analysis.

## Main Workflow and Implementation of Functions ----

# Normalize data using DESeq2 and EdgeR
deseq2_result <- normalize_deseq2(filtered_data, metadata_norm)
edger_result <- normalize_edger(filtered_data, metadata_norm)

# Visualizations for Normalizations
visualize_normalizations(filtered_data, deseq2_result$normalized_counts, edger_result$normalized_counts)
# The figure demonstrates how normalization reduces variability and adjusts for library size differences, improving the reliability of downstream analyses. In the Raw Counts panel, the variability is higher, with uneven medians, indicating potential biases due to differing sequencing depths. The DESeq2 Normalized and edgeR Normalized panels show more consistent medians across samples, demonstrating successful normalization. This consistency is critical for reducing technical noise and ensuring the biological signal drives subsequent analyses.

## Pathway Enrichment ----

visualize_pathway_enrichment(enrich_deseq2, title = "Top Pathways (DESeq2)")
# This bar plot illustrates the top pathways enriched in the Alzheimer's dataset based on DESeq2-normalized gene expression data. Pathways like "Alzheimer disease," "Parkinson disease," and "Pathways of neurodegeneration - multiple diseases" show significant enrichment, highlighting their strong association with neurodegenerative processes. The color gradient corresponds to adjusted p-values, with darker red representing higher significance, emphasizing the importance of these pathways in the context of Alzheimer's disease research.

visualize_pathway_enrichment(enrich_edger, title = "Top Pathways (edgeR)")
# Similar to the previous plot, this one displays the top pathways using the edgeR package. Both display the same diseases and processes, but the order and p-values differ, indicating and displaying the different normalization algorithms (median ratio method and TMM) effects. 

## Compare DESeq2 and EdgeR -----
# DESeq2 is computationally faster (0.384 seconds) than edgeR (0.888 seconds), while edgeR achieves a slightly lower mean coefficient of variation (0.453 vs. 0.456), indicating greater consistency in normalized values. This trade-off suggests that DESeq2 is preferable for speed, whereas edgeR might be slightly better for stability in gene expression normalization.
